          Now THAT is true, but we love web development even more. We talk about
          it on our blog, like, [a lot](http://bit.ly/2YA6999). We often craft
          live demos and open source these bad boys [on
          GitHub](https://github.com/snipcart). Matter of fact, this Planty
          theme [is open source
          too](https://github.com/snipcart/stackbit-theme-planty)! If you spot
          any bugs, open an issue, and we’ll fire our junior dev. Just kidding
          Michael, you’re good.

          Word. But good **code** _can_ solve a lots of problems, too. New _and_
          old. That’s why we help beginners get started with web development
          through free content and tools, like this theme. We also believe [the
          JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) might be one solid pillar on which we
          build that future.
